 I am Padma Prasanna, I have completed my graduation in Sri Vasavi engineering college in computer science. First of all, thank you for providing this internship. I am here to give the demo video for Automated Transcription System using Wishper Model. So the main goal of this assignment is to develop an Automated Transcription System that utilizes OpenAA WishforModel. In this project, I created a folder for Audio and Video Files. It scans and transcripts them automatically and saves the transcription as a test file. It also supports real-time monitoring. So any new media file added to the folder gets transcript instantly. Here is my project folder named TranscriptionProject inside which there is a media files folder where I can keep my audio and video files. Here I have the files like the BattleofFile.mp3 and for that picture.mp4. So it can support file types like MP3, MP4, wow. So I will run the Python script and it scans this folder and transcripts the media files. So if you want to run the Python code in PowerShell or VS Code Terminal, we have to type this command python transcript.py. The script detects media files and starts transcribing them using the WishforModel. The transcript file generated test files that is the BattleofFile.mp3.txt as you can see the transcription has been successfully saved in the same folder. So the main conclusion is this automated transcription system makes transcription fast, efficient, hard hands free. It eliminates any manual work, supports various media formats and can be extended with performance optimization. So thank you, thank you for watching.
