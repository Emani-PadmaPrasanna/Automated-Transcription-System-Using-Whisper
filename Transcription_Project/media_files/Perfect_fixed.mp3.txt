 I found a love for me Darling just died right in, I followed my lead I found a girl beautiful and sweet I never knew you were the someone waiting for me Because we were just kids when we fell in love Not knowing what if what I will not give you a good time Darling just kiss me slow, your heart is so lion And in your eyes you're holding my baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the cross, well listening to our favorite song When you said you looked at me, I whispered underneath my breath You heard it, darling you were perfect tonight Well I found a woman stronger than anyone I know She shares my dreams I hold it someday I'll share her home I found a love to carry more than just my secrets To carry love to carry children of our own We are still kids but we're so in love fighting against all odds And I'll be alright just time Darling just hold my hand We're my girl we are men I've seen a future in your eyes Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the cross, well listening to our favorite song When I saw you in that dress, it can so beautiful I don't deserve this darling you were perfect tonight Darling Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the cross, well listening to our favorite song When I saw you in that dress, it can so beautiful I have faith in what I see now I know I have met an angel in person She looks perfect I don't deserve this you look perfect tonight I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms Barefoot on the cross, well listening to our favorite song
